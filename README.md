# Step-by-Step Guide: Adding ESLint and Prettier to a React Vite Project
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up ESLint and Prettier in a React Vite project. ESLint helps in identifying and reporting patterns found in your JavaScript/TypeScript code, ensuring code quality, while Prettier is a code formatter that ensures consistent code style across your project. Together, they can improve the readability and maintainability of your codebase.

By the end of this guide, you'll have ESLint and Prettier fully integrated into your React Vite project, with automated linting and formatting that align with best practices.
##Step 1: Initialize a React Vite Project
If you haven't already created a Vite project, start by setting up a new one
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-vite-app --template react
```
Open your project directory 
```bash
cd my-vite-app
```
Then install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
